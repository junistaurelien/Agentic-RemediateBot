## 📌 Overview

**Agentic-RemediateBot** is an AI-assisted remediation planning engine that transforms vulnerability findings into structured, prioritized, and governance-ready remediation actions.

This project simulates an *agentic security workflow* where vulnerability telemetry is:

- Ingested and normalized  
- Contextually enriched with risk logic  
- Prioritized using structured scoring  
- Converted into remediation plans  
- Drafted into change-ready ticket content  
- Packaged with validation and audit evidence  

All actions are gated by **human approval** to preserve governance and operational safety.

---

## 🧠 What Makes This “Agentic”?

Unlike static automation scripts, RemediateBot demonstrates contextual orchestration:

✔ Applies weighted risk scoring beyond raw CVSS  
✔ Incorporates exploitability + environmental exposure  
✔ Dynamically assigns priority and SLA  
✔ Generates remediation + rollback instructions  
✔ Produces structured change request drafts  
✔ Packages evidence requirements for audit readiness  

This models **AI-assisted security reasoning**, not simple scripting.

## 🔁 Agentic Workflow

Backlog Ingestion  
→ Risk Enrichment  
→ Prioritization Engine  
→ Remediation Drafting  
→ Human Approval Gate  
→ Evidence Packaging  
→ Executive Reporting  

This simulates how modern SecOps teams integrate automation while maintaining governance controls.

## 📁 Key Outputs (Feb 12, 2026 Simulation)

- remediation_plan_2026-02-12.csv  
- change_request_2026-02-12.md  
- executive_summary_2026-02-12.txt  
- evidence_pack/manifest_2026-02-12.json  

All artifacts simulate real enterprise remediation coordination.

## 🔐 Governance Model

Remediation execution is intentionally NOT automated.

The system:
- Generates plans  
- Drafts structured change requests  
- Suggests rollback + validation  
- Packages evidence pointers  

Execution remains controlled under:

**Human-in-the-loop approval (CAB / Change Management)**

This design aligns with enterprise security best practices.

---

## 🚀 Ideal Use Cases

- Vulnerability Management Automation  
- Remediation Planning Acceleration  
- Change Request Draft Automation  
- Security Engineering Portfolio Demonstration  
- AI-Assisted SecOps Workflow Modeling  

---

## 📈 Positioning

Agentic-RemediateBot demonstrates how AI-assisted security workflows can be safely integrated into operational environments without bypassing governance controls.

It reflects a modernization approach to:

Security Automation  
SecOps Engineering  
Risk-Based Remediation  
AI-Augmented Decision Support
